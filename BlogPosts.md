## February 15th -  Second Project Idea

For the second project, I'm thinking of a project in which the user becomes a star traveller. I've always loved watching the night sky, and have wondered what the world would be like from up there. This longing intensified while reading "The Little Prince", while imagining a little boy travelling between stars and planets of different sizes and shapes.


In this project, I intend to give user a "Protheseus" like environment in which the user can travel to different planets and stars, accompanied by a little fox. The user will be able to interact with unique and distinct aspects of each star environment. Each star environment will include not only unique visual environment, but also physical distortions and unexpected interactions resulting from the distortion. The user will be provided utmost freedom to travel to different places, by raycasting and in a way soaring to one's destination. The goal is to provide an inviting and exciting environment for the user to explore.

## February 5th -  Interaction & Environment Screenshot
#### Interaction


A type of interaction that I have been taken by these days is that between online broadcasting jockeys, and their viewers. The interaction usually goes as follows: the jockey will do some attention grabbing action, depending on the their specialization. The viewers chat on a public room in real time with the jockey, communicating and often influencing the very nature of what takes place on the broadcast. 


A particular form of such interaction that I enjoy greatly is that of 먹방, or "meokbang", which roughly translates into "eating broadcast". It involves usually a single jockey interacting with the viewers as they consume an insane amount of food in one seating. In terms of the practical steps, in necessitates an inhumane appetite on part of the jockey, as well as a huge amount of food and a bunch of people willing to watch such a show.

As I've never been on the other side of the broadcast, I cannot attest much to the feeling from the jockey's side. However, there is a great satisfaction that comes from the viewer's side. It's unreal given that the viewer has no direct consumption of any food during the interaction itself. The act of just watching so much food being consumed is glorious. As the jockey's role involves not only eating, but also continuing the conversation between the individual viewers, the viewer feels included in the feat that is acheived. There is also another form of interaction through monetary payment throughout the viewing of the show, which is called the "Byeol Poongsun", the online currency on the broadcasting platform. By sending out this currency, the users indicate their pleasure and content with which the way the broadcast is taking place. 

After the interaction, the viewer is likely to feel quite hungry (at least in my personal experience).

#### Environment Screenshot

So far the steps have been generated as separate blocks that will differ in their heights as my understanding of Penrose staircase grows. The interaction added is keyboard based input to continue on the pathway.

## February 1st - Project 1 Concepts


Ever since reading a book called the "The Number Devil", I was fascinated by the concept of Penrose stairs. The hypnotic idea of a physical impossibility lures me in, as a metaphor for the endless stairs and loops in which we climb to perhaps attain the same height that we stay at. 
In this project, I hope to create(or somehow simulate) a Penrose stairs, creating an environment in which the procedure of continually walking down the stairs create a sense of entrapment. The user will be able to interact with the environment by looking at the next stair, by which they will continually move downwards, slowly realizing that the stairs in fact make a complete loop. I hope to create the "twist" if a user just stops walking and stairs away into a random place for a long enough time, by which the user can escape this endless loop, and be transported to another platform way above.

## January 30th - Environments


Even if you spend your whole day walking and exploring the city of Daegu,
the chances are that you will not come across a small stream called "Shincheon".
The stream is of such ambiguous size so that one would definitely need a bridge to cross it, but not quite big enough to qualify
as a river. This place brings me a peace of mind, one that I can just smile about imagining.


Being a stream, it comes with none of the overwhelming surroundings that comes with a big body of water in Korea -- no food vendors yelling,
no boats, no fishing enthusiasts, and no picniking families and their food trash remnants. Just simple, clear stream, and a couple of elderlies
here and there going about their daily exercise routines. Whenever I sit by the side, or just simply take a stroll around the stream, if I try hard enough
I can hear silence, as absurd as it is in the middle of a metropolitan area. The juxtaposition of silence and calm in the Sincheon, as opposed to the
busy lives visible in the city, it creates an other-worldly feeling that I cherish so deeply.
