## February 1st - Project 1 Ideas


Ever since reading a book called the "The Number Devil", I was fascinated by the concept of Penrose stairs. The hypnotic idea of a physical impossibility lures me in, as a metaphor for the endless stairs and loops in which we climb to perhaps attain the same height that we stay at. 
In this project, I hope to create(or somehow simulate) a Penrose stairs, creating an environment in which the procedure of continually walking down the stairs create a sense of entrapment. The user will be able to interact with the environment by looking at the next stair, by which they will continually move downwards, slowly realizing that the stairs in fact make a complete loop. I hope to create the "twist" if a user just stops walking and stairs away into a random place for a long enough time, by which the user can escape this endless loop, and be transported to another platform way above.

## January 30th - Environments


Even if you spend your whole day walking and exploring the city of Daegu,
the chances are that you will not come across a small stream called "Shincheon".
The stream is of such ambiguous size so that one would definitely need a bridge to cross it, but not quite big enough to qualify
as a river. This place brings me a peace of mind, one that I can just smile about imagining.


Being a stream, it comes with none of the overwhelming surroundings that comes with a big body of water in Korea -- no food vendors yelling,
no boats, no fishing enthusiasts, and no picniking families and their food trash remnants. Just simple, clear stream, and a couple of elderlies
here and there going about their daily exercise routines. Whenever I sit by the side, or just simply take a stroll around the stream, if I try hard enough
I can hear silence, as absurd as it is in the middle of a metropolitan area. The juxtaposition of silence and calm in the Sincheon, as opposed to the
busy lives visible in the city, it creates an other-worldly feeling that I cherish so deeply.
