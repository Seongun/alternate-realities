## March 27th -  Invisible City

Dorothea is a city which Marco Polo describes as a city that has two descriptions.
One may see it as a city in which there exists a complete rationalization, with division and sectorization of different parts of the city. Each part of the city has different functionalities, with almost sterile distinction and set rules by which the system works. Each section has a set number of houses, set number of chimneys, and so forth. The city can present itself as a limitation on one's actions, where it provides set number of options one must choose from.

One may also see it as a city, as the camel driver did, in thinking that this is a city with wonders and beauties, with endless choices that are present from the moment you encounter the city.

This city reminds me of the idea that from within life may appear as a repetition, yet from within the days and continuations are all different, all unique, and all valuable. that's why I liked this city a lot. 


## March 13th -  Third Project Idea


For the final project, I want to create a VR environment in which cooperation with other players is key to success. For some time I have been fascinated by a game called "Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes". It's a game in which a lay person is locked inside a room with a time bomb, and must diffuse it with the help of experts who has a manual for deactivating the bomb. The neat thing is, the expert cannot see or interact with the bomb, so they must literally continue talking in order to make sure the bomb is diffused.

However, in this experience, only the player in the bomb room is experiencing the VR, and the rest of the players are just sitting around and reading a manual. The manual itself is also fixed, so if a player plays the game enough times, there is no real need for any cooperations as the player can simply just remember all of the necessary information.

I want to create a similar but different experience in which a person in a commercial aircraft experiences that the pilot has died of a heartattack when a bird hits the airplane window. In order to successfully land the plane and save the passengers on board, the person(here on called the pilot) must communicate accurately with the person on the control tower, who luckily knows how to control the aircraft. The twist is, because the aircraft's window cracked when the bird hit (yes, unrealistic), the pilot must get feedback from the control tower to tell if the plane is going in the right direction. 
This will provide a two way interaction between the control tower and the pilot, as the control tower must now both relay the information of how to fly the plane, but also accurately assess whether the plane is flying correctly due to the actions told.

The interactions that can be present in this game are quite simple, as in that the pilot will have to maneuver the plane, while the control tower must track the plane and figure out how to land it, through communicating and flipping through manual.

If additional spectators are present, I believe that they can be co-pilots or control tower assistant, by which they could either aid in the role or just simply sit back and enjoy the efforts the players make.

## February 15th -  Second Project Idea

For the second project, I'm thinking of an interaction system in which the user becomes a star traveller. I've always loved watching the night sky, and have wondered what the world would be like from up there. This longing intensified while reading "The Little Prince", while imagining a little boy travelling between stars and planets of different sizes and shapes.


In this project, I intend to give user a "Proteus" like environment in which the user can travel to different planets and stars, accompanied by a little fox. The user will be able to interact with unique and distinct aspects of each star environment. Each star environment will include not only unique visual environment, but also physical distortions and unexpected interactions resulting from the distortion. The user will be provided utmost freedom to travel to different places, by raycasting and in a way soaring to one's destination. The goal is to provide an inviting and exciting environment for the user to explore.

## February 5th -  Interaction & Environment Screenshot
#### Interaction


A type of interaction that I have been taken by these days is that between online broadcasting jockeys, and their viewers. The interaction usually goes as follows: the jockey will do some attention grabbing action, depending on the their specialization. The viewers chat on a public room in real time with the jockey, communicating and often influencing the very nature of what takes place on the broadcast. 


A particular form of such interaction that I enjoy greatly is that of 먹방, or "meokbang", which roughly translates into "eating broadcast". It involves usually a single jockey interacting with the viewers as they consume an insane amount of food in one seating. In terms of the practical steps, in necessitates an inhumane appetite on part of the jockey, as well as a huge amount of food and a bunch of people willing to watch such a show.

As I've never been on the other side of the broadcast, I cannot attest much to the feeling from the jockey's side. However, there is a great satisfaction that comes from the viewer's side. It's unreal given that the viewer has no direct consumption of any food during the interaction itself. The act of just watching so much food being consumed is glorious. As the jockey's role involves not only eating, but also continuing the conversation between the individual viewers, the viewer feels included in the feat that is acheived. There is also another form of interaction through monetary payment throughout the viewing of the show, which is called the "Byeol Poongsun", the online currency on the broadcasting platform. By sending out this currency, the users indicate their pleasure and content with which the way the broadcast is taking place. 

After the interaction, the viewer is likely to feel quite hungry (at least in my personal experience).

#### Environment Screenshot

So far the steps have been generated as separate blocks that will differ in their heights as my understanding of Penrose staircase grows. The interaction added is keyboard based input to continue on the pathway.

## February 1st - Project 1 Concepts


Ever since reading a book called the "The Number Devil", I was fascinated by the concept of Penrose stairs. The hypnotic idea of a physical impossibility lures me in, as a metaphor for the endless stairs and loops in which we climb to perhaps attain the same height that we stay at. 
In this project, I hope to create(or somehow simulate) a Penrose stairs, creating an environment in which the procedure of continually walking down the stairs create a sense of entrapment. The user will be able to interact with the environment by looking at the next stair, by which they will continually move downwards, slowly realizing that the stairs in fact make a complete loop. I hope to create the "twist" if a user just stops walking and stairs away into a random place for a long enough time, by which the user can escape this endless loop, and be transported to another platform way above.

## January 30th - Environments


Even if you spend your whole day walking and exploring the city of Daegu,
the chances are that you will not come across a small stream called "Shincheon".
The stream is of such ambiguous size so that one would definitely need a bridge to cross it, but not quite big enough to qualify
as a river. This place brings me a peace of mind, one that I can just smile about imagining.


Being a stream, it comes with none of the overwhelming surroundings that comes with a big body of water in Korea -- no food vendors yelling,
no boats, no fishing enthusiasts, and no picniking families and their food trash remnants. Just simple, clear stream, and a couple of elderlies
here and there going about their daily exercise routines. Whenever I sit by the side, or just simply take a stroll around the stream, if I try hard enough
I can hear silence, as absurd as it is in the middle of a metropolitan area. The juxtaposition of silence and calm in the Sincheon, as opposed to the
busy lives visible in the city, it creates an other-worldly feeling that I cherish so deeply.
